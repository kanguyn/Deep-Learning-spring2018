# Deep-Learning-spring2018
Introduction to Deep Learning Labs

This repository contains Jypyter notebook python codes from the course Deep Learning taught at EURECOM, by prof. Benoit Huet, in Spring 2018.

The 3 labs were:
1. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): Handwritten Digits Recognition problem (yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) with different settings of hyperparameters
2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Handwritten Digits Recognition: using TensorFlow
3. Sentiment Analysis with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): using a Vanilla RNN and a GRU (Gated recurrent unit) on TensorFlow
